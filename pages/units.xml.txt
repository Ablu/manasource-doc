===== units.xml file configuration =====
Data from the ''units.xml'' file are used to set up the currency name and its subdivisions, but also weight unit names.

The units.xml file has to be located in the **data** directory.

Each configuration option in this xml file, is defined using a ''<unit>'' tag within the ''<unit**s**>'' main node, which itself has got an ''<level>'' child node, ...
Here is an example:

<file xml units.xml sample>
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<units>
    <unit type="currency" base="Kuna" round="0">
        <level symbol="Litas" count="1000" round="2"/>    
        <level symbol="Loti" count="100000" round="4"/>
    </unit>
    <unit type="weight" base="g" round="0">
        <level symbol="kg" count="1000" round="2"/>
    </unit>
</units>
</file>

**Note:** This file is used only by the client for customisation purpose.

==== <unit> node description ====

The ''<unit>'' node is used to define the different values used to bring a specific currency and weight subdivisions within the game.

This node is **required** by the client.

<file xml unit node sample>
 <?xml version="1.0"?>
 <units>
   <unit type="currency" base="Kuna" round="0">
   ...
   </unit>
 ...
 </units>
</file>

^ Parameter name  ^ Type ^ Mandatory ^ Default value ^ Description  ^
| type      |  string \\ defined value: \\ 'currency', 'weight'  |  Yes  | | Tells the system whether the unit is for the currency or the weight.  |
| base    |  string  |  Yes  |  | Tells the currency/weight name displayed by the client.  |
| round    |  integer  |  Yes  |  | Tells the currency round or precision. If equal to 0, every digit is counted. A round of 10 would make the currency display 0 for every digit before the dozen.  |

**Note:** Only one currency and one weight unit should be defined in the units.xml file for consistency.

=== <level> node description ===

The ''<level>'' node is used to set each currency/weight sublevels.

This node is optional.

<file xml level node sample>
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<units>
    <unit type="currency" base="Kuna" round="0">
        <level symbol="Litas" count="1000" round="2"/>    
        <level symbol="Loti" count="100000" round="4"/>
        ...
    </unit>
 ...
 </units>
</file>

^ Parameter name  ^ Type ^ Mandatory ^ Default value ^ Description  ^
| symbol    |  string  |  Yes  |  | Tells the currency/weight name subdivision displayed by the client.  |
| count    |  integer  |  Yes  |  | Tells the currency/weight subdivision base count. If equal to 0, it would be equal to the parent currency/weight. Eg: A Byte would have a count of 8 relatively to the Bit.  |
| round    |  integer  |  Yes  |  | Tells the currency/weight subdivision round or precision. If equal to 0, every digit is counted. A round of 10 would make the currency display 0 for every digit before the dozen.  |
