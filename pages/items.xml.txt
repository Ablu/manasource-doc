===== items.xml file configuration =====
Data from the ''items.xml'' file are used to set up configuration values about every items 
the players will be able to carry during his/her online experience.

The items.xml file has to be located in the **data** directory.

Each configuration option in this xml file, is defined using a ''<item>'' tag within the ''<item**s**>'' main node.
Here is an example:

<file xml items.xml sample>
 <?xml version="1.0"?>
 <items>
   <item id="501" name="Cactus Drink"
    image="use-potion-a.png|G:#22ff22"
    description="A fresh drink."
    effect="+15 HP"
    type="usable"
    hp="15"
    weight="4"
    max-per-slot="10"/>
    ...
 </items>
</file>

**Note:** This file can be used by both the client and the server if the necessary data is provided. That's why we provide options for both applications here for simplification and easier documentation purpose.
But when you should be careful to provide only the client data when dealing with client configuration, or the players will have more information about the items than they should.

=== TmwAthena specific parameters ===

The Mana server isn't concerned by the given parameters and will ignore them.


These "items" are purely virtual ones. They are used to configure the available hairstyle, races, and weapon type within
an TmwAthena session. The client use them to get in sync with server when dealing with such information.


== Hair Styles ==

**Note:** FIXME: The ManaServ client is using this hairstyle system for now. This should be fixed by adding the available hairstyle in a specific xml file, why not along with TmwAthena configuration. See the [[playerset handling improvement]] where a hairstyle node should be added.

<file xml hairstyle sample>
 <?xml version="1.0"?>
   <items>
    ...
    <item id="-9" type="hairsprite" name="Short and curly">
        <sprite>hairstyle9.xml</sprite>
    </item>
    ...
   </items>
</file>


^ Parameter name  ^ Type & Range ^ Description  ^
| id (for hairstyles)  |  integer \\ From -1 to -16?? \\ FIXME: What is the higher negative available value?  | The id used by both the client and the TmwAthena server to cope with this hairstyle.  |
| name (for hairstyles)  |  string  | The Hair Style name.  |

See the [[#<sprite> childnode description]] to get more information about the <sprite></sprite> part.

== Races ==

**Note:** FIXME: The ManaServ client is using this hairstyle system for now and the server doesn't support more than one race. See the [[playerset handling improvement]] where a race parameter should be added for both.

<file xml race sample>

   <items>
    ...
    <item id="-100" type="racesprite" name="Human">
      <sprite gender="male">player_male_base.xml</sprite>
      <sprite gender="female">player_female_base.xml</sprite>
    </item>
    ...
   </items>
</file>


^ Parameter name  ^ Type & Range ^ Description  ^
| id (for racesprites)  |  integer \\ From -100 to ?? \\ FIXME: What is the higher negative available value?  | The id used by both the client and the TmwAthena server to cope with this race.  |
| name (for hairstyles)  |  string  | The race name.  |

See the [[#<sprite> childnode description]] to get more information about the <sprite></sprite> part.


== Weapons ==

These //low-id// weapon are used to set which animation goes with which weapon for TmwAthena clients only.

<file xml weapons sample>
 <?xml version="1.0"?>

   </items>
</file>


^ Parameter name  ^ Type & Range ^ Description  ^

| weapon_type (for weapons)  |  integer  | Used to get in synchronization with the server when using this weapon-type. \\ **Do not be confused with the ''weapon-type'' parameter.**  |

See the [[#<sprite> childnode description]] and the [[#<sound> childnode description]] to get more information about the <sprite></sprite> and the <sound></sound> part.


== Miscellaneous ==

Those <item> parameters are used only by TmwAthena clients.

^ Parameter name  ^ Type ^ Mandatory ^ Default value ^ Description  ^

==== <effect> childnode description ====

This childnode is used to provide information about what the server should do when dealing with an item. This node is used by the client and manaserv v1 to define advanced items behaviour, and replace old hp, mp, script parameters, ...

Note that an item can have more than one effect, and more than one effect per type.

<file xml effect sample>
 <?xml version="1.0"?>
   <items>
    ...
     <item id="1"
      image="candy.png"
      name="Dagger">
       <effect trigger="activation">

            <consumes />
        </effect>
     </item>
     ...
     <item id="521"

    ...
 </items>
</file>

^ Parameter name  ^ Type ^ Mandatory ^  Default value  ^ Description  ^
| trigger    |  string  |  Yes  |  "" \\ Must be one of the predefined parameters.  | This parameter is used to tell when the effect should be triggered. The folloing events can be triggered: \\ ''in-inventory'': This event is triggered when the item is in the player inventory. \\ ''activation'': This event is triggered when the item is used/activated. \\ ''leave-inventory'': Triggered when leaving the inventory. (Dropped, consumed after use, sold, traded, ...)  \\ ''equip'': Triggered when the player equips the item. (Note: When the item is equippable, it isn't stackable anymore. i.e.: The max-per-slot parameter it reset to 1.) \\ ''unequip'': Triggered when the player unequips the item. \\ ''equip-change'': Triggered when an equipped item is replace by another. Note that this item will also trigger the equip event of the newly equipped item, and the unequip trigger of the current item. FIXME: This is redundant in 99% of the cases and may be removed in near future.   |
^ ''<consumes />'' sub-childnode ^^^^^
| The only presence of this tag is sufficient to tell the server that the item must be removed after triggering that event. Hence, it will be used mostly for use-once item like simple potions, etc... but it may technically be used for any event, leading to surprising effects.  |||||
^ ''<script>'' sub-childnode ^^^^^
^ Parameter name  ^ Type ^ Mandatory ^  Default value  ^ Description  ^
| src  |  string  |  Yes  |  ""  | The script filename to use when activating/deactivating the item. The file is relative to the ''data/scripts/items/'' folder.  |
| function  |  string  |  Yes  |  ""  | The script function called in the script file when activating the item.  Note that two parameters are pushed to this function: The item user being pointer, and the item Id. Your function can have the following form: function activate_function_name(user, item_id), for instance.   |
| dispell-function  |  string  |  Yes  |  ""  | The script function called in the script file when deactivating the item.  Note that two parameters are pushed to this function: The item user being pointer, and the item Id. Your function can have the following form: function activate_function_name(user, item_id), for instance.  |
| **Note:** Item can't use the built-in schedule functions at the moment!  |||||
^ ''<modifier>'' sub-childnode ^^^^^
| Modifiers are here to modify attributes when an event is triggered. An item can have 0 to many modifiers for each event.  |||||
^ Parameter name  ^ Type ^ Mandatory ^ Default value ^ Description  ^
| attribute  |  string  |  Yes  |  ""  | This value must correspond to one of the ''tag'' parameter present in the <modifier> node of the [[attributes.xml]] file. They are used to trigger an effect on the player's attributes. I.e.: Increasing or decreasing strength when equipped, raise speed when activated, ect...   |
| value  |  integer  |  Yes  |  0  | This value indicates of how much the effect on the attribute tag is applied. The actual effect is depending on how you've configured the attribute's modifier.   |
^ ''<attack>'' <effect> childnode  ^^^^^
| See [[attackconfiguration#XML Attack Node|Attack Node Configuration]] |||||

==== <floor> childnode description ====

This childnode is used to provide sprite and particle information for the item when it is on the floor. This can contain <sprite> and <particlefx> tags, which function as above.
