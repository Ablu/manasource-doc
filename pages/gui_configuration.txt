====== GUI configuration ======

You'll find below the files and options available in order to customize the Mana client's GUI.

===== GUI Theme support =====

The Mana client is aimed at being a generic client, supporting the necessary branding functions for other maintainers.
Hence, a GUI theming support has been added through the following branding option: ''guiThemePath''. See the [[branding.xml]] page.

The above option permits to provide an alternate path to the gui files, thus making the client load a different skin set.
The GUI theme path is relative to the ''data/'' folder. Also, when GUI files are not found in the theme path, the default ones are used instead.

===== GUI Data handling =====

Here is a description of each required XML and PNG files used to set up the Mana client GUI:

===== Discussion =====

<file comment Bertram 2010/10/07>
As already said before, the GUI customization development should not be
our priority (rather make the servers work, and the client more stable.)
Anyway, a very relevant thing to do would be to add custom padding support in the windows.xml file,
as it has been requested here: http://mantis.themanaworld.org/view.php?id=774
And as it may fix that bug, too: http://mantis.themanaworld.org/view.php?id=816 (Bug rendering tabs.)
