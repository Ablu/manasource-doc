===== monsters.xml file configuration =====
Data from the ''monsters.xml'' file are used to set up configuration values about every computered related beings 
the players will encounter during the online experience.

The monsters.xml file has to be located in the **data** directory.

Each configuration option in this xml file, is defined using a ''<monster>'' tag within the ''<monster**s**>'' main node, which itself has got an ''<attributes>'' child node, and some others.
Here is an example:

<file xml monsters.xml sample>
 <?xml version="1.0"?>
 <monsters>
    <monster id="0" name="Maggot" targetCursor="small">
      <attributes
        hp="20"
        size="4"
        speed="2.0"
        evade="5"
        physical-defence="5"
        magical-defence="0"
        mutation="50"
      />
      <attack id="1"
        priority="1"
        type="physical"
        warmuptime="10"
        cooldowntime="10"
        reusetime="10"
        basedamage="10"
        deltadamage="1"
        chancetohit="1000"
        element="neutral"
        range="32"
        animation="attack"
      />

      <exp>10</exp>
    </monster>
 </monsters>
</file>

**Note:** This file can be used by both the client and the server if the necessary data is provided. That's why we provide options for both applications here for simplification and easier documentation purpose.
But when you should be careful to provide only the client data when dealing with client configuration, or the players will more information about the monsters than they should actually have.


==== General (Client and server) nodes description ====


=== <monsters> node description ===

The ''<monsters>'' node is the monsters.xml file main node and permits to determine monsters definition start and ending.
This node has only one parameter for now, ''offset'', which is added to all the monster IDs. It defaults to 1002 for the
TmwAthena protocol, for backwards compatibility with older clients, which did it automatically in the netcode.

This node is **required** by both the client and the server.

<file xml monsters node sample>
 <?xml version="1.0"?>
 <monsters>
 ...
 </monsters>
</file>



=== <monster> node description ===

The ''<monster>'' node is used to define the different values used to bring a specific monster up to life within the game.
Each monster's definition is then defined within its start and ending tags.

This node is **required** by both the client and the server.

<file xml monster node sample>
 <?xml version="1.0"?>
 <monsters>
   <monster id="1" name="Monster Name">
   ...
   </monster>
 ...
 </monsters>
</file>

^ Parameter name  ^ Type ^ Mandatory ^ Default value ^ Description  ^
| id      |  integer  |  Yes  | | It is the id of the monster. This parameter has to be unique for each monster. \\ The system will use the monster id to refer on it in many ways.  |
| name    |  string  |  No  |  "unnamed"  | Tells the monster name. Used to ease configuration on server and with the client \\ but displayed to players on the client side.  |
| targetCursor    |  string  \\ defined value  |  No  |  "normal"  | Used by the client only. Tells which circle cursor size should be use when displaying the target cursor around the monster sprite while in game. It mainly depends on the sprite's pixel size. \\ Acceptable values are: \\ small \\ normal \\ large  |

| gender | string | No | unspecified | The gender of the monster. Valid values are: "male", "female", "unspecified". This information has no effect on the behaviour of the being. But if a gender is set the client can display this gender. |
