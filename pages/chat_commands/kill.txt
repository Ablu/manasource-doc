===== Synopsis =====
  @kill <character>
  
Kills a player character by setting its hit points to 0. This will trigger the [[on_chr_death handler]] and [[on_chr_death_accept handler]] like any "natural" death.

===== Examples =====
Kill the character "Bob"
  @kill Bob
Kill the character "Bob the Builder" (note the spaces in the name)
  @kill "Bob the Builder"
Kill yourself (alternative to [[@die]])
  @kill #    

===== Security =====

**Critical** 

This command is intended to be used by game master as a disciplinary tool. It can also be useful from time to time to free players who are stuck in various situations. Needless to say that it has a lot of potential for harassment and does not belong in the hands of an untrusted user.
