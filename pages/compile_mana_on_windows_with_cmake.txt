===== Compiling Mana on Windows using CMake =====

  * Get the Mana sources either from git or download the latest release. We'll assume they are at ''C:\mana''
  * Get the [[http://forums.themanaworld.org/viewtopic.php?f=6&t=5356|mana_libs.zip]] package
  * Extract ''mana_libs.zip'' somewhere (current version creates a ''tmw_libs'' directory). For this howto we'll assume ''C:\tmw_libs''
  * Install [[http://www.cmake.org/|CMake]]. Be sure to tell it to add itself to the system PATH during the installation (unless you know wat you're doing), either for current or all users.
  * Install [[http://www.mingw.org/|MinGW]]. Take the latest [[http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/files/Automated%20MinGW%20Installer/mingw-get-inst/|Automated MinGW Installer]] and be sure to check C++ from the MinGW Compiler Suite. Install location is assumed to be ''C:\MinGW''.\
  * Add the MinGW bin directory ''C:\MinGW\bin'' to your ''PATH'' (My Computer -> Properties -> Advanced -> Environment Variables -> Edit PATH -> Append '';C:\MinGW\bin'', including the semicolon unless the variable didn't exist yet).

Now that was the whole installation procedure. Now let's start on the actual compiling.

  * Open a command prompt (Start -> Run -> ''cmd'')
  * Verify that ''cmake'' and ''g++'' are available (otherwise something went wrong in the install procedure above, and it makes no sense to continue without fixing that)
  * Go to ''C:\mana'' (type ''c:'' and then ''cd \mana'')
  * Generate Makefiles with CMake by doing: 

  cmake -G "MinGW Makefiles" -DCMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH=C:\tmw_libs\include -DCMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH=C:\tmw_libs\lib -DSDL_INCLUDE_DIR=C:\tmw_libs\include\SDL -DSDLIMAGE_INCLUDE_DIR=C:\tmw_libs\include\SDL -DSDLMIXER_INCLUDE_DIR=C:\tmw_libs\include\SDL -DSDLNET_INCLUDE_DIR=C:\tmw_libs\include\SDL -DSDLTTF_INCLUDE_DIR=C:\tmw_libs\include\SDL -DMINGW_INCLUDE_DIR=C:\MinGW\include

(Yes, this command is insane, we should look into shortening that up a bit...)

  * Check that it went alright (it should say "''-- Build files have been written to: C:/mana''" at the end)
  * Start compiling by typing ''mingw32-make''
