A jail map is a map you design without any regular way to enter or leave. It can thus only be entered or left with the help of a [[chat commands|chat command]] like [[chat_commands:warp|@warp]], [[chat_commands:goto|@goto]] or [[chat_commands:recall|@recall]].

Such a map can have various purposes:
  * an environment for testing on a production server without any interference by regular players
  * "parking lot" for your own bots
  * private meeting place for server personnel
  * temporary confinement of characters suspected of breaking server rules, especially illicit bots.
  * an alternative to [[chat_commands:ban|@ban]] as a way of suspending abusive players
