====== Client and server ports ======

=== Mana Client ===

The Mana Client has currently only nightlies and a beta port for Windows. See [[http://www.manasource.org/downloads.html|here]] for downloading it.

You can also see [[http://wiki.themanaworld.org/index.php/Ports|the ports page]] from the Mana World wiki, which is technically the previous and latest stable version of the current Mana client.

=== Mana Server ===

The Mana official server hasn't any port yet. You'll have to obtain and install all the dependencies and get the source code and compile it for now.

=== Willing to make a new port? ===

You don't find the port you wanted to download and you're willing to make a port?
Thank you for this. :)
