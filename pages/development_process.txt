====== Development Process ======

Manasource is a bazaar-style project which is open to input from users and invites everyone to contribute code. But we still need a bit of red tape to keep the development organized. This article describes how a change gets into the official codebase.

===== Using github.com =====

This process is the recommended process. Depending on how big and important the change, not all steps are mandatory.

^ step ^ mandatory ^ where ^ who ^ what ^
| 0 | only for large and complex new features | http://doc.manasource.org | anyone | creates a RFC article describing a new feature an link it on [[Requests for Comments]]|
| 1 | only for non-trivial changes or changes you can't do yourself | http://bugs.manasource.org | anyone | creates a bugtracker issue which points out a bug or proposes a new feature |
| 2 | only for non-trivial changes or changes you can't do yourself | http://bugs.manasource.org | all Manasource developers | discuss whether the issue needs to be resolved |
| 3 | only for non-trivial changes or changes you can't do yourself | http://bugs.manasource.org | implementing developer | assigns the issue to himself / herself |
| 4 | always | http://github.com (personal fork) | implementing developer | creates a new branch for solving the issue |
| 5 | always | http://github.com (personal fork) | implementing developer | commits his/her solution to the branch |
| 6 | always | http://github.com/mana | implementing developer | opens a pull request for his/her branch |
| 7 | when there is a bugtracker issue | http://bugs.manasource.org | implementing developer | creates a comment mentioning the pull request |
| 8 | when the solution is non-trivial | http://github.com/mana | all Manasource developers | discuss whether the solution is acceptable |
| 9 | always | http://github.com/mana | any Manasource developer | expresses his/her agreement with the solution |
| 10 | always | http://github.com/mana | implementing developer | merges the pull request |
| 11 | when there is a bugtracker issue | http://bugs.manasource.org | implementing developer | closes the bugtracker ticket with a comment mentioning the commit hash |
| 12 | when necessary | http://doc.manasource.org | implementing developer | documents the change on the wiki | 

===== Using only the bugtracker =====

This alternative process is for casual contributors who don't want to create a github account. It should be used for small contributions only.

^ step ^ where ^ who ^ what ^
| 0 | http://bugs.manasource.org | anyone | creates a bugtracker issue which points out a bug or proposes a new feature |
| 1 | http://bugs.manasource.org | all Manasource developers | discuss whether the issue needs to be resolved |
| 2 | http://bugs.manasource.org | implementing developer | uploads a patch with the proposed solution to the issue |
| 3 | http://bugs.manasource.org | all Manasource developers | discuss whether the solution is acceptable |
| 4 | http://bugs.manasource.org | any Manasource developer | expresses his/her agreement with the solution ((Please excuse that patches in bugtracker issues are easily overlooked. Feel free to ask for a review (or reason for not reviewing) on [[IRC]] when your patch is ignored for too long.)) |
| 5 | http://github.com/mana | the developer who agreed with the patch | pushes the patch to the main repository |
| 6 | http://bugs.manasource.org  | the developer who agreed with the patch | closes the issue mentioning the commit hash |
